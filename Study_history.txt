- Edited the stimulus script to make it so that subjects can respond during the 600ms probe instead 
	of having to wait to the response period. Subs on and before today would have the other version
	of the script, so their fast RT's also somewhat reflect processing during the Probe. 
	Have to inspect those to see if there are many trials in which an RT wasn't recorded
	because maybe they were responding during the Probe.
